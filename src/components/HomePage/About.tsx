            Full-Stack Engineer with a strong emphasis on frontend, bringing over {yearsWorking}+ years of experience
            building user-centric web applications. I&apos;m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and modern
            frameworks like React. While I have a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development and enjoy
            working across the stack, my true passion lies in crafting intuitive interfaces and elevating user
            experiences. Coming from an athletic background, I thrive in collaborative, high-performing teams,
            leveraging collective strengths to achieve shared goals.

            Outside of work, I enjoy golfing and spending time with my family. My wife and I have been married since
            2021 and are happily raising our sons, Connor & Benjamin. I hold a purple belt in jiu-jitsu and can hold my
            own in a game of volleyball â€” when my knees are feeling up to it.
